// Instructions
// Using this object :

// let client = "John";

// const groceries = {
//     fruits : ["pear", "apple", "banana"],
//     vegetables: ["tomatoes", "cucumber", "salad"],
//     totalPrice : "20$",
//     other : {
//         paid : true,
//         meansOfPayment : ["cash", "creditCard"]
//     }
// }
// Hint: To do this daily challenge, take a look at today’s lesson Pass By Value & Pass By Reference

// Create an arrow function named displayGroceries, that console.logs the 3 fruits from the groceries object. Use the forEach method.

// Create another arrow function named cloneGroceries.
// In the function, create a variable named user that is a copy of the client variable. (Tip : make the user variable equal to the client variable)
// Change the client variable to “Betty”. Will we also see this modification in the user variable ? Why ?
// In the function, create a variable named shopping that is equal to the groceries variable.
// Change the value of the totalPrice key to 35$. Will we also see this modification in the shopping object ? Why ?
// Change the value of the paid key to false. Will we also see this modification in the shopping object ? Why ?

// Invoke the cloneGroceries function.

let client = "John";

const groceries = {
  fruits: ["pear", "apple", "banana"],
  vegetables: ["tomatoes", "cucumber", "salad"],
  totalPrice: "20$",
  other: {
    paid: true,
    meansOfPayment: ["cash", "creditCard"],
  },
};

const displayGroceries = () => groceries.fruits.forEach((e) => console.log(e));

displayGroceries();

const cloneGroceries = () => {
  let user = client;
  client = "Betty";
  let shopping = groceries;
  groceries.totalPrice = "35$";
  groceries.other.paid = false;
};

cloneGroceries();
// We will not see the modification in the user variable because we passed the user by value.
// We will see the modification in the shopping object becaus4e it is passed by reference. shopping is the copy of the groceries object.
// We will see the modification in the shopping object for the exact same reason.
